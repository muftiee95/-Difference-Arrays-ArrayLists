Functions of Arrays in Java

An Array in Java is a fixed-size, indexed collection of elements of the same data type. It provides direct access to elements using an index, making retrieval very fast. Arrays are efficient in terms of memory usage and performance because they have a fixed size and minimal overhead.

Functions of ArrayLists in Java

An ArrayList is a part of Javaâ€™s java.util package and is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. Unlike arrays, ArrayLists provide built-in methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements, making them more flexible and easier to use.

Conceptual Differences Between Arrays and ArrayLists
Size: Arrays have a fixed size, while ArrayLists can dynamically resize themselves.
Type Flexibility: Arrays can store primitive types directly, while ArrayLists store objects (even primitive types must be wrapped using wrapper classes like Integer for int).
Performance: Arrays are faster for direct data access and manipulation, while ArrayLists offer more flexibility at the cost of performance due to resizing operations.
Built-in Methods: ArrayLists provide utility methods (add(), remove(), contains(), etc.), whereas arrays require manual manipulation using loops.
